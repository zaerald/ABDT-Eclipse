# ðŸ‘·WIP ABDT Eclipse
## AnyaBasic Development Tools for Eclipse

This project aims to integrate [AnyaBasic][abs] to the [Eclipse IDE][eclipse] which is one of the popular IDEs, and start developing there by also simply opening the AnyaBasic (`.abs`) file or drag and drop files then run it directly to the Eclipse IDE.

### History
Got interested on [AnyaBasic][abs] language but there's a friction when starting to try it out or develop with this language, you have to use the [ConTEXT IDE][context] which is great but you have to set up different things first.
